# Conway's game of Life

This is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in `js` with Svelte as the used
framework. If you don't know what GoL is have a look at
[Wikipedia's article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

# Disclaimer

I'm not a frontend developer and I'm using this small project to get the hang of
`javascript` and `Svelte`.
